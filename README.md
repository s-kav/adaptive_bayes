## Observations

- **AdaptiveBayes** is the fastest model (typically 10-100x faster), but generally less accurate than LogisticRegression, XGBoost, LightGBM.
- **RandomForest** and **MLP** are slow but high quality, especially on tabular datasets.
- **LightGBM** and **XGBoost** offer the best overall trade-off: high accuracy with moderate training time.
- **AdaptiveBayes** is the only model to leverage GPU memory out of the box.

---

## Model Selection Guide

- **For production with memory constraints:** Use XGBoost.
- **For maximum training speed:** AdaptiveBayes.
- **For maximum accuracy:** RandomForest (if memory is not critical).
- **For balance:** LightGBM or XGBoost.

## Technical Analysis and Suggestions

**Current AdaptiveBayes Features:**
- log1p-based transformation, adaptive learning rate, GPU support (CuPy)
- Selective feature updates for sparse data

**Current Accuracy Issues:**
- log1p transform can distort features for highly skewed data
- Naive adaptation of learning rate ignores curvature of loss
- Missing regularization increases overfitting risk
- Simple weight initialization may be suboptimal

**Enhancement Proposals:**
1. Improved feature transforms (tanh, arctan, identity)
2. L1+L2 regularization
3. Adaptive LR with uncertainty/confidence
4. Newton's step using Hessian diagonal approximation
5. Xavier or He initialization
6. Momentum & Early Stopping
7. Explicit bias term

> *Expected accuracy boost: 2-8% depending on dataset.*

## Conclusion

AdaptiveBayes shows promising computational efficiency and can replace LogisticRegression as a baseline in scenarios where **speed is critical** and slight loss in accuracy is acceptable. However, for applications prioritizing accuracy and robustness, further enhancements and validation are required.
